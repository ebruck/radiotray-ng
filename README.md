# Radiotray-NG: An Internet radio player for Linux #

It became clear as one of the early contributors to the RadioTray project that it
was not getting the attention it required and was probably dead. A lot of the 
technologies it used had moved on to newer versions and the bugs started piling up.
I did my best to help users, but a new start was required.

The version here is what "I" wanted out of RadioTray.

## Radiotray-NG goals were: ##

* Cross platform friendly design as I occasionally use a Mac.
* Better gstreamer error handling and recovery.
* Fix RadioTray's flawed bookmark format.
* Build in the only RadioTray plugin that I felt I needed, which is a shutdown timer.
* Per station/group notification icon support.
* Better parsing of the stream meta data and optionally more stream info displayed.
* A bit more attention to notification details and formatting.

## Where Radiotray-NG is: ##

* RadioTray functionality
* Theme support
* Debian packaging
* Cross compile on Mac (via brew packages) using a very simple ncurses interface.
* Full AppIndicator support
* No groups within groups by design to keep the interface clean.
* Volume up/down support using mouse wheel (left/right can also be used)
* Media key support
* Dbus interface for controlling Radiotray-NG and accessing stream meta data
* --play command line option for resuming playback

## Future: ##

* ~~Cross platform bookmark editor application.~~
* Mac support (icons, menu, media keys etc.)
* ~~Script to convert RadioTray's bookmarks.xml to the new format.~~

## Bugs: ##

* Radiotray-NG's user-agent is created at compile time. Which means a binary created on 16.10 will report that even when run on 16.04.

## Config File ##

A config (radiotray-ng.json) is created in your ~/.config/radiotray-ng directory with the following defaults:
```
{
   "bookmarks" : "~/.config/radiotray-ng/bookmarks.json",
   "bookmark-editor" : "rtng-bookmark-editor",
   "buffer-duration" : 2,
   "buffer-size" : 320000,
   "compact-menu" : false,
   "debug-logging" : false,
   "file-monitor" : true,
   "file-monitor-interval" : 10,
   "invert-menu" : false,
   "last-station" : "",
   "last-station-group" : "",
   "notification-verbose" : true,
   "notifications" : true,
   "sleep-timer" : 30,
   "split-title" : true,
   "track-info-copy" : false,
   "ihr-title" : true,
   "tag-info-verbose" : true,
   "volume-level" : 100,
   "volume-step" : 1,
   "wrap-track-info" : true,
   "wrap-track-info-len" : 40,
   "media-key-mapping" : false,
   "media-key-previous-station" : "Previous",
   "media-key-next-station" : "Next",
   "media-key-volume-up" : "",
   "media-key-volume-down" : "",
   "media-keys-old-dbus-name" : false,
   "radiotray-ng-on" : "radiotray-ng-on",
   "radiotray-ng-off" : "radiotray-ng-off",
   "radiotray-ng-notification" : "radiotray-ng-notification",
   "root-group-bottom-pos" : true

* No checks are made if a media key assignment collides with another action.

## Bookmarks Format ##

Bookmarks are defined in the following JSON format:
```
[
   {
      "group" : "group name 1",
      "image" : null,
      "stations" : [
         {
            "image" : null,
            "name" : "station name",
            "url" : "http://station/station.pls"
         },
         ...
        ]
   },
   {
      "group" : "group name 2",
      "image" : "~/Dropbox/radiotray-ng/images/station.png",
      "stations" : [
         {
            "image" : null,
            "name" : "station name",
            "url" : "http://station/station.pls",
            "notifications" : false
         },
         ...
        ]
   },
   ...
]
```
Group with the name "root" is treated differently and is rendered at the base of the menu. A group's image specifies the notification icon to display and is inherited by all of the stations. A station with an image overrides the group image.

Use the "Preferences/Reload Bookmarks" option to see your changes.


## Convert RadioTray Bookmarks ##

The rt2rtng script will convert your RadioTray bookmarks.xml file. All groups within groups are moved to the root and any empty ones are removed. It's not a perfect conversion and will no doubt require some editing.

```
$ rt2rtng ~/.local/share/radiotray/bookmarks.xml > bookmarks.json
```


## Bookmarks Editor ##

The Bookmarks Editor is a simple editor that enables management of your bookmarks file eliminating the need for manually editing the file. The editor will attempt to open the default bookmarks file on startup, but you can select to open another bookmarks file if desired. This provides you with the ability to manage multiple bookmark files.

The editor supports all of the typical editor operations including adding, editing and deleting of both groups and stations. Images are easily selected via standard browsing functionality. You can also arrange the groups and stations using simple drag-n-drop actions.

* Use Radiotray-NG's reload bookmarks after saving your changes.

## DBus Interface ##

```
Available commands:

    volume_up
    volume_down
    set_volume 'level'
    play
    play_url 'url'
    stop
    quit
    previous_station
    reload_bookmarks
    next_station
    get_bookmarks
    get_config
    get_player_state
    play_station 'group' 'station'
```
```
Example:

$ qdbus com.github.radiotray_ng /com/github/radiotray_ng com.github.radiotray_ng.get_player_state
{
   "artist" : "Suspense",
   "bitrate" : "24 kb/s",
   "codec" : "MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)",
   "group" : "Old Time Radio",
   "image" : "radiotray-ng-notification",
   "state" : "playing",
   "station" : "AM 1710 Antioch OTR",
   "title" : "Jul 15, 1948: Summer Night w/Ida Lupino",
   "volume" : "15"
}
```
